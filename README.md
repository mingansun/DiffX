# ExprX - an R package to streamline interspecies differential expression analysis
---
__ExprX__ is an R package to streamline interspecies differential expression
analysis. Using RNA-Seq data for human and mouse brain, this vignette
demonstrates how to detect differentially expressed genes among species
using ExprX package. All essential steps (eg. data import, ortholog matching,
data normalization, differential analysis and visualization) are described below.

## Install ExprX
To install __ExprX__ from GitHub by using the __install_git__ function from __devtools__ package:

library(devtools)

install_git("https://github.com/mingansun/ExprX")

To load the ExprX package:

library(ExprX)

## How to use ExprX
Please refer to the Vignette about how to use __ExprX__ to perform interspecies differential
expression analysis. The PDF version of Vignette can be downloaded from:
